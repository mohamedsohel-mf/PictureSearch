# Picture Search By Geolocation

## Challenge Description 
Design & develop a responsive web application that searches for pictures using Flickr API, based on user input and presents the results.

This challenge is designed to test your ability to write code that inter-operates with a third-party API as well as develop a simple user interface.

## Challenge Specification
The user should be able to:
- Search for a location, and see the thumbnails of the first 10 photos available for that location. Navigation should be available to get the next 10 photos
- Perform the search either by entering latitude and longitude, or selecting a location from a preset list. Locations in the preset list should be represented by a human-readable name.
- Add entries to the preset list by supplying a longitude, latitude and name. **This list should be stored in the backend.
- Add photos in a search result to a favourites list. **This list should be stored in the backend.
- View thumbnails of the photos in the favourite list
- Your frontend should not connect to Flickr API directly.

## What we are looking for
How you design and structure an application given a set of requirements.

How you build maintainable code.

How does the final result look (user experience).

## Frameworks
Any Node framework is acceptable - but the use of a framework is not required.

You can use any third party CSS frameworks to make your life easier.

Building it as a SPA (Use ReactJS, Vue.js etc)

Avoid using unnecessary libraries

## Build/Run
Use any build tools you prefer.

We want to easily run your application, so provide a brief description on how to build, run and test your project.

*Bonus points are given for how well you present this project's documentation.*

## Deliverables
New branch in this Git repository where your code resides

Bonus for a live running version

## Hints
We don't have any time limit for this test, but we believe you can finish it within two days.

We would like to see a production quality project, ready to ship. 

Keep in mind edge cases and error handling. Let us see your understanding of it from code, build process and view design/layout point of views.
